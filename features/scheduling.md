Scheduling is the most important part of everyday business, and therefore it has to be as smooth and easy to use as possible.

### Easy to view calendar

You can view your calendar by month, week or day. You can filter you calendar by student, client, tutor or job and you can even colour code your 
calendar, meaning you can view it however you want, when you want.

</a>

### Tutors and clients can log in to view their hours

With our tutor and client log ins, your clients can log in to view their calendar, and can even integrate it with their own calendars!

### Tutors can log their own hours

Allow your tutors to log in and log their own hours, giving you more time to run your company. Own system is optimised for mobile so they can do it on the move.

### Upload learning resources

Documents and images can be uploaded by the tutor, client, student or admin to a job, meaning your students and tutors can make the most out of any sessions by being properly prepared.

### Lesson reports

Tutors can fill in a report at the end of every lesson, which can be customised with your own fields. The notes are then sent to the client with their invoice without them needing to log in.
