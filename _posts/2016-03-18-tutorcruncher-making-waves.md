We were delighted to be featured this week by our friends over at [businessadvice.co.uk](
http://businessadvice.co.uk/on-the-up/tutorcruncher-how-accidental-intrapreneurship-lead-to-a-new-business-which-is-shaking-up-an-industry/) about how TutorCruncher, originally designed to solve a problem for a single tutoring agency, has now gone to transform an entire industry. Initially the software was developed in-house to solve the time consuming business of invoicing clients and paying tutors. With significant additional development this is only the beginning of what TutorCruncher can do, as it now provides a comprehensive communication, invoicing and payment tool for agencies, tutors, clients and pupils.

There are multiple ways that tech can help you grow your small business. Check out here for some ideas:

Whilst there are many accounting and invoicing apps available, but few which were built to respond to the specific problems you may be facing in your tuition agency and which also integrates customer management and financial analytics in a simple-to-understand, user-friendly package.
