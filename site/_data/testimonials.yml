    "Quintessentially Education has found TutorCruncher to be a highly effective system which has transformed the way we
    are able to manage both clients and tutors. By having all tutors’ and clients’ data in one place, it has enabled the
    business to run smoothly and grow. The lesson logging and reporting is highly efficient and  allows us to keep an eye
    on our tutor placements without having to interfere, which is appreciated by both tutors and clients. The invoicing
    system is simple and works brilliantly, and the new Stripe integration is a fantastic addition which we are looking
    forward to setting up. The system is backed up by the wonderful TutorCruncher team who could not be more helpful."

    "We at Athena Tuition found TutorCruncher just the nick of time. As a fast growing tutoring agency providing the best
    possible tutors across London and the United Kingdom, we quickly began to find ourselves deluged by paperwork, from
    invoices, to lesson logs, to payment orders, and much more. All of these we initially managed with separate systems-
    with growing difficulty. Finding TutorCruncher, we found a ready-made system built entirely for and centred around the
    needs of a tutoring agency - which managed all of these various systems in one single place.<br><br>

    Using it since then has been an absolute no-brainer, and at it's core, its basic function is time saving. As a business,
    why waste hours every week manually performing functions which are done automatically and better by TutorCruncher, for
    lower than it costs in human hours? TutorCruncher is like having a new person in the business. We haven't looked back!"

  company: The Profs

    "The Profs began using TutorCruncher around 6 months after we began operations. Until then, all the information we
    had for tutors, students, jobs, and payments was recorded on a series of very confusing and disordered spreadsheets.
    Due to the amount of administrative time it took to keep these up-to-date, we were very limited on the number of
    students and tutors we could handle at anyone time. The move on TutorCruncher has lead to a great increase in the
    efficiency of the work we do, and has allowed us to expand rapidly into the tuition market.<br><br>

    The integrated payments, smooth operating system, and user-friendly design, have given us a hugely scalable product,
    and the amount of time we have saved has allowed us to focus on growing our business into new and exciting areas! It
    is safe to say that we would not be where we are today without the support of TutorCruncher."

    "Gabbitas implemented TutorCruncher in December 2015. Since doing so, the system has really helped speed up our
    processes, by significantly decreasing our amount of administration and paperwork.
    The system permits us to manage each tutoring assignment effectively, allowing us to
    dedicate more time to our tutors and clients and provide them with the high class service
    they deserve! We have received excellent support from the Tutorcruncher team and they have
    been on hand to answer any questions or queries we have incurred along the way."
