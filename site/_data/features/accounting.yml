  title: Automatic Invoicing &amp; Payroll
  text: |
    Dealing with accounting effectively is time consuming, wouldn't it be great if you had more time to grow your business?<br><br>

    TimeCruncher automatically generates your invoices using the data from appointments, so you can be sure that you are
     billing for the correct amount. The draft invoices can then be reviewed and sent to your clients.

  title: Tax Calculations included
  text: |
    Unlike other business management software, TimeCruncher automatically calculates tax on invoices,
     which can be applied in any way, depending on the model of your business and your tax setup.<br><br>

    If you are acting as an agent for your contractors then TimeCruncher allows you to charge for the job via the contractor.
     This means that because you are acting as an agent and not a service provider that the tax will only be charged on
     the commission that the contractor pays you, giving you the obvious benefits.<br><br>

  title: Credit Control
  text: |
    Managing credit control is easy - TimeCruncher will show you who hasn't paid and, by sending them a reminder,
     you can make sure your clients always remember to pay. Since the main reason for bad debtors is simply forgetting to pay,
     we've made it as easy as possible for clients to pay using our online payments.

    As well as automating the invoicing process, TimeCruncher generates Payment Orders for you to send to your contractors to
     let them know how much you are paying them, and what for.
