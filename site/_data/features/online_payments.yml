  title:  Card Payments
  text: |
    We've partnered with the Card Payment provider Stripe to allow you to take card payments. Invoices received by clients
     have a link for paying by card without them having to log in, and your clients can save their card details so
     that future payments can be made with just one click. <br><br>

    Admins can also take payment over the phone for those clients who prefer to talk to someone, or admins can take deferred
     payments for those clients who save their details.<br><br>

    Stripe's card processing fee differs per country, so check out <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">Stripe's pricing page</a> for details.
