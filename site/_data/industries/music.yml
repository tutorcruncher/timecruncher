  title:  Easy Self Sign Up and Customisable Profiles
  text: |
    Teachers can set up their own profiles with just a few clicks. They can fill in their details, such as information regarding their professional
     experience and skills, upload a profile picture and much more. As an administrator, you have direct access to the profiles of all your users,
     whether they're teachers, students or clients. TimeCruncher even allows you to collect more information by adding new, fully customisable fields.

  title:  Adjustable Filter Options
  text: |
    Finding the perfect teacher for each student is a crucial part of your business. TimeCruncher allows you to filter your contractors by any attribute given in a profile or even
     your own custom fields. This makes it a lot easier for you to match students and teachers.

  title:  Simple and Intuitive Calendar Function
  text: |
    You can view all of your school's lessons per day, week or month. Filter the calendar by teacher, student, status or location of a lesson. A simple
     colour code makes your schedule clearer and more structured. Using iCal integration, any user can synchronise the TimeCruncher calendar with their own one.

  title:  Teachers Can Apply for Jobs
  text: |
    If you haven't decided which teacher you'd like to assing to a job, you have the option to make it 'Available for Application'. This allows teachers to apply for that job
     directly and even compete on the rate they will do it for.

    You can also send out notifications to all or only some of your teachers asking them to apply.

     area to make it easier for you to assign a job to a particular teacher.

  title:  Create Repeated Lessons
  text: |
    Lessons can be repeated on a weekly or daily basis and be scheduled to continue until any set date. You can create a source lesson and then automatically
     repeat it in one easy step.

  img-alt: Simply create an original lesson and set it to be repeated for a long as you wish.
-
  title:  Lesson Reminders
  text: |
    You can customise lesson reminders regarding their target audience and the time you want to send them.
     For instance, you could set a reminder to go out to all students 24 hours before each lesson.

  img-alt: Make sure your students and teachers never forget a lesson.
-
  title:  Share Content Easily
  text: |
    Documents and other resources can be directly uploaded to lessons. You can also add a description and customise access permissions to make sure that your document can only be
     viewed by users it's relevant to.

    A good use of this is for your teachers to upload their qualifications for the client to view, or for the client to download any relevant forms to fill in.

  title:  Teachers Log Own Lessons and Create Reports
  text: |
    TimeCruncher allows your teachers to log their own hours instead of requiring you to manage their schedules.

    Teachers are also able to create reports after each lesson so that when the client receives their invoice, they receive information from the
     teacher regarding the progress the student made, recommendations for further lessons etc.
     Like most of TimeCruncher, reports are customisable so that they can help you record any and all relevant information.

  title: Monitor Students' progress
  text: |
    TimeCruncher keeps track of how your students' performance improves over time. You can filter the reports by date range, teacher or student.
     For instance, you could compare the performance of all students one teacher has in order to evaluate that contractor's teaching skills.

  title:  Automated Invoices
  text: |
    Using the lesson data you provide, TimeCruncher automatically generates invoices. In order to make sure you're billing the correct amount, you can review
     drafted invoices before sending them to clients.

  title:  Customisable Invoices
  text: |
    In order for your invoices to portray the correct image to your clients, you can customise your invoices to look as smart as possible, for instance by including
     your company logo, address details and more. You can even tailor them further for your business with our editable templates.

  title:  Tax Included
  text: |
    TimeCruncher does not only automatically calculate the correct amount of tax on each invoice; it also allows you to customise and apply different tax setups,
     giving you more time to grow your business.

    If you are acting as an agent for your music teachers, TimeCruncher allows you to charge for the job via the contractor. Since you are then no longer
     acting as a service provider, the tax will only be charged on the commission that the teacher pays you, giving you the obvious benefits.

  img-alt: Automatically include the correct amount of tax in your invoices.
-
  title: Credit Control
  text: |
    Managing credit control is easy - TimeCruncher will show you who hasn't paid and, by sending them a reminder, you can make sure your clients always remember
     to pay. Since the main reason for bad debtors is simply forgetting to pay, we've made it as easy as possible for clients to pay using our online payments.

  title:  Paying your Teachers
  text: |
    In addition to automatically generating invoices, TimeCruncher also generates payment orders for you to send to your teachers to inform them about
     the amount you are paying them and the exact lessons those payments refer to.
  img: industries/po-example.png
  img-alt: Payment orders can be generated just as easily as invoices.
-
  title:  Automated Emails
  text: |
    With TimeCruncher, you can create email styles for almost anything, such as lesson reminders, sending invoices or welcoming a new client.
     You can of course customise your emails to include your own content and company logo and even write your own HTML templates.

    Our integrated mail service allows you to send emails from your own address so that your clients can reply straight to your inbox.

  title:  Card Payments
  text: |
    We collaborate with the Card Payment provider Stripe to allow you to take card payments. Invoices received by clients also feature a link for paying by card without
     them having to log in, and your clients can save their card details for future payments.

    Admins can also take payments over the phone, which is a great tool for clients that prefer to talk to someone. Furthermore, admins can take deferred
     payments for clients saving their details.

    Stripe's card processing fee differs per country, so check out <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">Stripe's pricing page</a> for details.
