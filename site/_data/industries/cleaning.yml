  title:  Cleaners Can Apply for Jobs
  text: |
    If you haven't decided which cleaner you'd like to assing to a job, you have the option to make it 'Available for Application'. This allows cleaners to apply for that job
     directly and even compete on the rate they will do it for.

    You can also send out notifications to all or only some of your cleaners asking them to apply.

    If you provide locations on appointments, your cleaners can use our maps integration to get directions. Use your client's address or a custom location to let
     your cleaners know where to go.
