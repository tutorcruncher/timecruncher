  title:  Cleaners Can Apply for Jobs
  text: |
    If you haven't decided which contractor you'd like to assing to a job, you have the option to make it 'Available for Application'. This allows cleaners to apply for that job
     directly and even compete on the rate they will do it for.

    You can also send out notifications to all or only some of your cleaners asking them to apply.

  title:  Customisable Reports

    Cleaners can create reports for each appointment so that when a client receives their invoice, they also receive information about the work that was completed.
     Of course these reports are customisable, so that any and all relevant information can be recorded.

  title:  Automated Invoices

  title:  Tax Included
  text: |
    TimeCruncher doesn't just automatically calculate the correct amount of tax on each invoice, but it also allows you to customise and apply different tax setups,
     giving you more time to grow your business.

    If you are acting as an agent for you instructors, TimeCruncher allows you to charge for the job via the instructor. Since you are then no longer
     acting as a service provider, the tax will only be charged on the commission that the instructor pays you, giving you the obvious benefits.

  title:  Credit Control
  text: |
    Managing credit control is easy - TimeCruncher will show you who hasn't paid and, by sending them a reminder, you can make sure your clients always remember
     to pay. Since the main reason for bad debtors is simply forgetting to pay, we've made it as easy as possible for clients to pay using our online payments.

  title:  Paying your Contractors

    In addition to automatically generating invoices, TimeCruncher also generates payment orders for you to send to your cleaners to inform them about
     the amount you are paying them and the exact jobs those payments refer to.

  title:  Card Payments
  text: |
    We collaborate with the Card Payment provider Stripe to allow you to take card payments. Invoices received by clients also include a link for paying by card without
     them having to log in, and your clients can save their card details to facilitate future payments.

    Admins can also take payments over the phone, which is a great tool for those clients who prefer to talk to someone. Furthermore, admins can take deferred
     payments for clients who save their details.

    Stripe's card processing fee differs per country, so check out <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">Stripe's pricing page</a> for details.
