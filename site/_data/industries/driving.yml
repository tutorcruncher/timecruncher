  title:  Teachers Can Apply for Jobs

    If you can't decide which teacher to assing to a job, you have the option to make it 'Available for Application'. This allows teachers to apply for that job
     directly and even compete on the rate they will do it for.

    You can also send out notifications to all or only some of your teachers asking them to apply.

  title:  Share Content Easily

    Documents and other resources can be directly uploaded to jobs. You can also add a description and customise access permissions to make sure that your document can only be
     viewed by users it's relevant to.

    A good use of this is for your instructors to upload their qualifications for the client to view, or for the client to download any relevant forms to fill in.

  title:  Instructors Log Own Lessons and Create Reports
  text: |
    TimeCruncher allows your instructors to log their own hours instead of requiring you to manage their schedules.

    Instructors are also able to create reports after each lesson so that when the client receives their invoice, they receive information from the
     instructor regarding the progress the student made, recommendations for further lessons etc.
     Like most of TimeCruncher, reports are customisable so that they can help you record any and all relevant information.

  title: Monitor Students' progress
  text: |
    TimeCruncher gives you an overview of the development of your students' performance over time. You can filter the reports by date range, instructor or student.
     For instance, you could compare the performance of all students one instructor has in order to evaluate an instructor's teaching skills.

  title:  Automated Invoices
  text: |
    Using the lesson data you provide, TimeCruncher automatically generates invoices. In order to make sure you're billing the correct amount, you can review
     drafted invoices before sending them to clients.

  title:  Tax Included
  text: |
    TimeCruncher does not only automatically calculate the correct amount of tax on each invoice, but also allows you to customise and apply different tax setups,
     giving you more time to grow your business.
     
    If you are acting as an agent for your instructors, TimeCruncher allows you to charge for the job via the instructor. Acting as an agent rather than a service
     provider means that the tax will only be charged on the commission that the instructor pays you, giving you the obvious benefits.

  img-alt: Automatically include the correct amount of tax in your invoices.

  title: Credit Control
  text: |
    TimeCruncher makes it easy for you to manage credit control - You can see at a glance who hasn't paid their invoices yet and quickly send them a reminder.
     Since the main reason for bad debtors is simply forgetting to pay, we've made it as easy as possible for clients to pay using our online payments.

  title:  Paying your Instructors

    TimeCruncher can automatically generate both invoices and payment orders, making it easy for you to inform your driving instructors about the amount you are paying them and
     the exact lessons those payments refer to.

  title:  Detailed Business Analysis
  text: |
    TimeCruncher keeps track of your monthly cashflow and breaks it down into income, revenue, expenses, tax and more. You can see information such as
     what type of lesson generates the highest revenue or the lessons each instructor is teaching.

  title:  Card Payments
  text: |
    We collaborate with the Card Payment provider Stripe to allow you to take card payments. Invoices provide a link enabling clients to pay by card without them
     having to log in. Of course, clients can save their card details to facilitate future payments.

    Admins can also take payments over the phone, which is a great tool for those clients who prefer to talk to someone. Furthermore, admins can take deferred
     payments for clients who save their details.

    Stripe's card processing fee differs per country, so check out <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">Stripe's pricing page</a> for details.
