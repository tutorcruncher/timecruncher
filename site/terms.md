## Fee Calculations

TimeCruncher fees are made up of two components: a fixed monthly fee and a usage fee which is proportional the revenue Companies put through TimeCruncher.

Companies on the enterprise tier may negotiate an agreement where they pay no usage fee. For more details on pricing see the [pricing page](/pricing).

Fixed monthly fees are charged retrospectively via invoice. Usage fees are calculated and charged in two steps:

1. For "electronic payments" (eg. where money is collected by Stripe or GoCardless) linked to TimeCruncher an "application fee" is applied at transaction time
based on the usage fee percentage.
1. The total revenue for a company (eg. sum of charges for complete or "cancelled but chargeable" appointments and undeleted Ad Hoc Charges) for 
each calendar month is calculated. The sum of electronic payments is then subtracted to arrive at "total non-electric revenue", the percentage usage 
fee is then calculated and added to the invoice along with the monthly fee.
